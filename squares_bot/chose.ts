/**
 * this ai should optimally take higher and higher win chance move until reacgin 100%, fragmentization is welcome
 * 
 * 
 * fragmentization: the more secluded and fragmentized tiles are, the better the ai can think to future and also have prepared path when it realizes the winning move
 * stable turns: in 5x5 first player always wants to block odd amount of tiles, whereas second one wants to block even
 * win chance: after reaching optimal number of turns just cut of those, that have many answers
